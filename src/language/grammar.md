## 1. English Core Grammar
### 1.1. Core Theory
Two basic sentence components: subject + verb 

The core of English grammar: verb

### 1.2. Verb Classification (Predicate Verbs and Non-Predicate Verbs)
- Predicate Verbs
  - Infinitive (do)
- Non-Predicate Verbs
  - To + Indinitive (to do)
  - Gerund (doing)

### 1.3. Five Predicate Verbs and Five Simple Sentences
Five Predicate Verbs
- Intransitive Verbs (Verbs without an object)
  - eg. Nick sleeps.
- Monotransitive Verbs (Verbs with one object)
  - eg. Nick loves me.
- Ditransitive Verbs (Verbs with two objects: a direct object and an indirect object)
  - eg. Nick teaches me AI. 
    - (Saying "Nick teaches me" feels incomplete, while saying "Nick teaches AI" feels somewhat complete, so "AI" is the direct object and "Me" is the indirect object)
- Complex-Transitive Verbs (Verbs with one object, but need a complement)
  - eg. Nick considers me smart. 
    - (While there's only one object, saying "Nick considers me" feels incomplete. However, "smart" doesn't act as another object like in ditransitive verbs. It provides additional information about the existing object.)
- Linking Verbs (Acting as an "equal"(=) sign)
  - eg. Nick is/looks tall.
    - Nick = tall (assigns the quality of "tall" to Nick)
  - eg. Nick is in a room.
    - Nick = in a room (assigns the state of "being in a room" to Nick)

Five Simple Sentences (Dividing by the calssification of predicate verbs)
- Subject + Intransitive Verbs
- Subject + Monotransitive Verbs + Object
- Subject + Ditranstive Verbs + Indirect Object + Direct Object
- Subject + Complex-transitive Verbs + Object + Object Complement
- Subject + Linking Verbs + Subject Complement

### 1.4. Four Dimensions of Predicate Verbs (TAMV)
Tense (T) x Aspect (A) x Mood (M) x Voice(V)
- Tense (4)
  - Past
  - Present
  - Future
  - Past Future 
    - (The future from a past perspective is unrelated to the present. It could be a point in time before the present, or it could be a point in time after the present.)
- Aspect (4)
  - Simple
  - Continuous
  - Perfect
  - Perfect Continuous
    - (A portion has been completed, while the rest is still ongoing; it's a state of being completed yet continuing forward.)
- Mood (3)
  - Indicative Mood (most common)
    - Lisa is quiet.
    - Is Lisa quiet?
  - Imperative Mood (commands, requests, advice)
    - Lisa, be quiet.
  - Subjunctive Mood (contrary to fact)
    - If Lisa were quiet, I might study.
- Voice (2)
  - Active Voice
  - Passive Voice

![Tenses](images/english_tenses.png)

⚠︎  "will" can be replaced with "shall"; "would" can be replaced with "should."  
⚠︎  The tenses in gray are less commonly used.

### 1.5. Non-simple Sentences (Compound Sentence and Complex Sentence) and Non-Predicate Verbs
Non-simple Sentences (Compound Sentence and Complex Sentence)
- Compound Sentence
  - Explanation: Use conjunctions for coordination
- Complex Sentence
  - Explanation: Replace elements (except the predicate) in the main clause with a subordinate clause (Note: can be embedded infinitely)
    - nouns
      - Subject Clause
      - Object Clause
      - Subject Complement Clause
      - Appositive Clause
    - adjectives
      - Attributive Clause
    - adverbs
      - Adverbial Clause

Non-Predicate Verbs (to do or doing)
- Purpose: To simplify subordinate clauses.
- Scope: Non-Predicate Verbs can replace almost all types of subordinate clauses.
- Note: Non-predicate verbs lack the three dimensions of predicate verbs.


### 1.6. Elements of Sentences and Parts of Speech
Ten Parts of Speech (10)
- Nouns
- Pronouns

## 3. German Core Grammar

### 3.1. Part of Speech
![alt text](images/german_part_of_speech.png)

### 3.2. Germen Order
#### 3.2.1. Four Simple Sentences
- declarative sentence
  - verb is on the 2nd case，end in "."  
- general questions sentence
  - verb is on the 1st case, end in "?" 
- special questions sentence (start with "w-")
  - "w-" is on the 1st case and verb is on the 2nd case，end in "?"  
- Imperative sentence
  - verb is on the 1st case，end in "!" 


Note： 70% of German verbs are placed in the second position, and 30% are placed in the first position.

#### 3.2.2. Modal Verb Sentence
Structure(hamburger structure) : Modal verbs are placed in the position where the verb should be placed, and the true verb prototype is always placed at the end of the sentence

Note: If there is "nicht" in modal verb sentence, the base form of the verb takes priority and is placed at the end of the sentetnce, while nicht becomes the penultimate form.
  
#### 3.2.3. The order of A and D
```
D(noun),A(noun): D + A
eg. Der Mann schenkt der Frau Blumen.
---
D(noun),A(pronoun) || D(pronoun),A(noun): pronoun + noun
eg. Der Mann schenkt ihr Blumen.
eg. Der Mann schenkt sie der Frau.
---
D(pronoun),A(pronoun): A + D
eg. Der Mann schenkt sie ihr.
``` 

### 3.2.4. Complex and Compound Clauses Order
- Complex Clauses
  - Verb second
  - Past participle to the end 
  - Infinitive to the end
  - Verb to the end in subordinate clauses 
    - Subordinate clauses begin with conjunctions such as 'if' ('wenn'), 'that' ('daß'),
  'until' ('bis'), 'because' ('weil'), so that ('damit'), when ('wenn'). The rule is that
  the verb goes to the end in a subordinate clause. 
    - NB: In written German (eg if you are putting up classroom notices), there is
  always a comma between a principal clause and a subordinate clause. 
  - Subordinate clause before main clause
- Compound Clauses
  - If you join two principal clauses together in German with und (and), aber (but),
oder (or) or denn (for), that does not affect word order; it does not invoke the
verb second rule. 

#### 3.2.5. Adverbial Order: Time, manner, place

When there is more than one adverbial phrase in a sentence, the rule is that
time (T) comes before manner (M), which comes before place (P). 

time > manner(reason) > place  

Examples
```
Ich fahre heute abend (T) mit dem Auto (M) nach Glasgow (P). - I am going
by car to Glasgow this evening.
Ich bin letztes Jahr (T) mit dem Zug (M) nach Paris (P) gefahren. - I went to
Paris last year by train.
Letztes Jahr (T) sind wir mit dem Rad (M) durch den Schwarzwald (P)
gefahren. - Last year, we went by bike through the Black Forest.
```
NB: Note that the word order in English for the second of these examples is quite different from the German.

## 4. German Detail Grammar
### 4.1. Nouns
Key Points:
- gender
  - masculine
  - feminine
  - neuter
- plurals
  - singular
  - plural
- cases
  - (1)Nominative (subject)
  - (4)Accusative (direct objects)
  - (3)Dative (indirect objects)
  - (2)Genitive (indicates possession or relationship)

---
All nouns in German are capitalized in writing.

Two of the three nouns are similar in English and German.

There is no logic to explain which noun will have which gender in German.

There are different ways of
forming the plural of nouns and no rules to memorise. 

The only solution is, each time you learn a new noun, to learn the gender and the plural form at the same time.
#### 4.1.1. Gender
|der|die|das|
|--|--|--|
|-ig|-ung|-o|
|-ich|-tion|-um|
|-ing|-tät|-zeug|
|-ling|-schaft (collection, eg. Mannschaft(team))|-chen ( little，eg.Mädchen(little girl))|
|-er/-ist/-ent/-or/eur (Profession)|-heit (adj. to noun, end in -lich,-ig,-bar)|-lein (little)|
|months|-keit (adj. to noun, other)|-nis (90%)|
|seasons|-ie|Foreign origin nouns|
|days|-ei|Verb to noun (essen （eat, verb） ->  Essen （meals, noun）)|
|some metals|-e (80%)||
|most precious stones|-t (80%)||
|-mus|
|The stem of verb to noun (Beginnen(Verb) -> Beginn(Noun))|


There is no logic to explain which noun will have which gender in German.

- masculine
  - Male persons or animals, the seasons, months, and days
  -  ending in -ant, -ast, -ich, -ig, -ismus, -ling, -or and -us
- feminine
  - Female persons or animals, and numerals
  - ending in
-a, -anz, -ei, -enz, -heit, -ie, -ik, -in, -keit, -schaft, -sion, -sis, -tät, -tion, -ung and -ur
- neuter
  - Young persons or animals, metals, chemical elements, letters of the alphabet,
hotels, restaurants, cinemas, continents, countries and provinces
  - end in -chen, -icht, -il, -it, -lein, -ma, -ment, -tel, -tum, and -um. Nouns
referring to things that end in -al, -an, -ar, -ät, -ent, -ett, -ier, -iv, -o and -on
  - most words with the prefix ge-
  - most nouns ending in -nis and -sal
#### 4.1.2. Plurals Rules
Plural nouns in German are unpredictable, so it's best to memorize the plural form
with the singular. However, here are some rules that can help:
- Feminine nouns usually add -n or -en. Nouns that end in -in (such as the female
equivalents of masculine nouns) add-nen.
  - eine Lampe zwei Lampen
  - eine Tür zwei Türen
  - eine Studentin zwei Studentinnen
  - eine Gabel zwei Gabeln
- Masculine and neuter nouns usually add -e or -er. Many masculine plural nouns
ending in -e add an umlaut as well, but neuter plural nouns ending in -e don't. Plurals
that end in -er add an umlaut when the stem vowel is a, o , u or au.
  - Masculine
    - ein Rock zwei Röcke
    - ein Mann zwei Männer
  - Neuter
    - ein Heft zwei Hefte
    - ein Buch zwei Bücher
- Masculine and neuter singular nouns that end in -er either add an umlaut or change
nothing at all. Many nouns with a stem vowel of a, o, u or au add an
umlaut. Masculine and neuter singular nouns that end in -el also add nothing at all
(with three exceptions: Pantoffel, Stachel, Muskel).
  - Masculine
    - ein Bruder zwei Brüder
    - ein Kegel zwei Kegel 
  - Neuter

### 4.1.3. Cases
Four Cases:
- 1. Nominative (subject)
- 4. Accusative (direct objects)
- 3. Dative (indirect objects)
- 2. Genitive (indicates possession or relationship)

All nouns (as well as pronouns and adjectives) have a case depending on what
function they serve in the sentence.

The nouns you look up in a dictionary will be in the nominative case.

### 4.7. Verb Tenses
- the present tense
- the past tense
- the future tense

#### 4.7.1. Present Tense
Key Points:
- How do you express the present tense?
- Regular (weak) verbs
- Irregular (strong) verbs
- The negative
- Separable Verbs
- Impersonal Verbs 


The Type of Verbs

- Common Verbs
  - In German, there is only one way of saying present tense.
- Weak Verbs (stem ends in '-t', - Examples include: 'arbeiten' (to work), 'warten' (to wait), 'kosten' (to cost). )
  - Weak Verbs add an extra '-e' in the second person familiar form, singular and plural, and in the third person
singular. 
- Strong Verbs
  - Strong verbs change the vowel in the stem of the infinitive, but only in the
second and third person singular; and then add the normal endings.
    - Some change the vowel in the stem
    - Some add an Umlaut to the vowel in the stem
    - Some are just irregular, such as the verb 'to have' - 'haben' - and the verb 'to
know' - (facts/information, not people) - 'wissen':

The negative
- nicht
- kein


#### 4.7.2. Past Tense
In German, there are two main past tenses:
- the perfect tense
- the simple past tense

The perfect tense in German has two parts: the present tense of 'haben' (to
have) or 'sein' (to be) plus the past participle. 

The past participle
- common verbs
- weak verbs
  - add 'ge-' at the beginning and '-t' at the end
- strong verbs
  - add 'ge-' at the
beginning and '-en' at the end
  - Note also that strong verbs mostly change the
vowel in the stem

The perfect tence
- separable verbs
- reflexive verbs
- 'sein'
- 'haben'

The simple past tense 
- 'sein'
- 'haben'
- some modal verbs

#### 4.7.3. Future Tense and Conditional Tense (werden)

### 4.8. Asking a question
#### 4.8.1. Question Words
- wer (who)
- was (what)
- warum (why)
- wann (when)
- wo (where)
- wie (how)
- wen (whom acc.)
- wem (whom dat.)
- wieso (how come)
- woher (where from)
- wohin (where to)
- welche/-r/-s (which)

### 4.9. Adverbs
In German, there is no difference between the adjective and the adverb. 

Examples
```
Dornröschen ist schön. - Sleeping Beauty is beautiful.
Sie singt schön. - She sings beautifully. 
```
#### 4.9.1. 'gern'
You can add the adverb 'gern' to a verb in German to convey the meaning of
'liking to do something'. Used in this way it has very much the same meaning
as the modal verb 'mögen'. 

### 4.10. Prepositions
|Acc|Dat|Acc+Dat|
|--|--|--|
|gegen|aus|an|
|entlang|mit|auf|

### 4.11. Numbers
#### 4.11.1. Cardinal Numbers
![](images/gerrman_cardinal_numbers.png)

Note: German uses a comma, in both the spoken and the written language, where English uses the decimal point.

#### 4.11.2. Ordinal Numbers
Ordinal numbers are 'first', 'second', 'third', etc. They are, in effect, adjectives.
In German they take normal adjective endings.

Rules:
- 1-19 : -te
  - Exception: 1st(erste), 3rd(dritte), 8th(achte)
- 20- : -ste
